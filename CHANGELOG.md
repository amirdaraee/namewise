# Use local Ollama service
namewise rename ./documents --provider ollama --dry-run

# Use LMStudio with custom model
namewise rename ./files --provider lmstudio --base-url http://localhost:1234 --model codellama

# Enhanced person name detection (Sarah example)
# Input: visitor-visa-application-for-family-in-canada.pdf (in folder "no")
# Output: sarah-visitor-visa-application-for-family-members-in-canada.pdf
```
